# Handwritten-Digits-Recognition-Using-CNN
I try to explore a model build by convolutional neural network (CNN), a popular and modern technique for handwritten digitsâ€™ recognition. And get 96% accuracy with small loss.
The dataset I used here has total 70,000 data and they are divided into three segments: 55,000 data for training (mnist. train), 10,000 data for testing (mnist. test) and 5,000 data for validation (mnist. Validation). 
Each data form MNIST has two parts: an image of a handwritten digits and its corresponding label. Each image is 28 pixels by 28 pixels. And it can be represented in an array vector 28 X 28 = 728 pixels.
